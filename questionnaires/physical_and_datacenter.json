Offices, on the other hand, are much harder to secure because a lot of people need frequent access. In addition to being directly connected to data centers on a network level, offices host the physical machines that are used to access data. Unless the office is sufficiently protected, attackers might use physical access to (for example) set up back doors on machines or steal local data, including credentials that can then be used to access information in data centers."
